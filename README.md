Articles worth reading. Ideas worth translating.

A personal archive of articles and posts I find valuable, preserved in my native language.

## Why this exists

Information clusters in English-speaking circles. There are excellent articles in Japanese, but the reverse is also true.

I want to save articles, X threads, and personal blog insights in my own language — to revisit, to reflect, to learn.

This isn't just a translation archive. I select only what I think is worth keeping, and add my own commentary when needed.

## Selection criteria

- Articles I learned from
- Insights I want to reference later
- Content I judge worth preserving in my native language

Virality and popularity don't matter. Only whether it has value to me.

## Content policy
